Kairos is an open source project that I am starting to start learning how to create online website communities.
The beginning goal is to implement the following features to each of the niche websites I will be creating.

There will be a custom version of this website running parallel to my home-server as a test machine to see
how much workload can be created in the home use and to begin preparing for the larger scale.

The first features include:

MediaWiki implementation
Video playback
User login
Document viewing
Picture viewing
Forums
File uploads

I will be breaking down the site into the following categories:

Home
Videos
  -Anime
  -Movies
  -TV Shows
  -Documentaries
  -Lectures
Pictures
  -TBA
Forums
MediaWiki
