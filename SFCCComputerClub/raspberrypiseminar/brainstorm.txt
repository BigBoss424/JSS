Creating this presentation for the Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi 2. To be able to complete this presentation I would need the following:

1) A Central Theme
2) A Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi 2
3) A machine running the latest Windows 8.1
4) A Projector for the Presentation itself

Central Theme: 

	Ideas: 	

	Linux for Everyone
	Transferring your Workload from Windows to Linux

	Chosen Theme: Transferring your Workload from Windows to Linux

	As this will be my main theme, I believe that I can demonstrate how 	   one can transfer their entire workload from Windows 8.1 to Raspien.	      Should I also include the steps required to install Raspien on the 	 Raspberry Pi itself?
