*   Description: This program will be used as a utility program to build the necessary functions for 
*   extracting and inputing different data types for the different file types. The main support I want to 
*   create first will be simply a text file. From there I plan on moving onto a .csv (Comma Seperated Values)
*   to allow files to be written, read , manipulated by the program itself. The end goal being common support for all
*   database values.
