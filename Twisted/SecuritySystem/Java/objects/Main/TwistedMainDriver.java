 * Description: This is the main driver class in which I will be executing my program 
 * from to begin with. I believe testing this application out in the console and getting it
 * to successfully work within the console is key before moving into the GUI phase of development.
 * I'll be importing Scanner in this program just because it's Scanner and needs to be implemented
 * anyways.

 * Bugs:

 * Fixes:
