Creating an application suite for a client at Twisted Hair Salon

Things that are required to complete the suite:

1) Create a Database on otacon424 using MySQL for the user information
2) Create a Database for the data that the user will be inputting using MySQL. 
3) Might need to purchase another server using DigitalOcean as a medium for this project. 

The Application Suite

1) Check In Application

	- The purpose behind this application is to enable the customers to login their information according to the system that is already in place. Such that it is simple and easy to use. I believe using jSwing as the GUI for this application should suffice. 
 
2) Access Key Application

	- The purose behind this application is to enable the client to update the security codes given to each customer by grouping 16 seperate four didgit codes to the given customer group. 
	- To enable this application integration with MySQL is a must. 

3) Management Application

	- The purose behind this application is to enable the client to manage all the security codes given to the customers. To view and edit the customers on a constant basis as well as give a log of the customers as they use the login application.
