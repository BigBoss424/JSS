I will be creating programs for my TI-83 Calculator to make math simplier from this point forward.

The following area below this will be details on what I intend to create with this folder and future
projects from this point forward.

1) Hello World

I will be creating a simple program for my TI-83 calculator to simply display helloWorld. The
purpose of this project is to gain a perspective on the syntax in the language I will be programming
for.
